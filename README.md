# The Tableau Colour Palette Converter project

From small quick ideas, awesome tools are created....

I thought of this idea and in less than 24hrs the first version is released!

Initial feedback was great, and there's some great ideas that I want to implement in the future (ie soon!)

This is also my first public repo, so be gentle if I don't know all the proper Github functionality.
